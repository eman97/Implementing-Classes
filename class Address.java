/*Implement a class Address . An address has a house number, a street, an optional
apartment number, a city, a state, and a postal code. Supply two constructors: one
with an apartment number and one without. Supply a print method that prints the
address with the street on one line and the city, state, and zip code on the next line.
Supply a method public boolean comesBefore(Address other) that tests whether this
address comes before another when the addresses are compared by postal code.*/
