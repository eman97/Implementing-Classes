/*Implement a class Car with the following properties. A car has a certain fuel
efficiency (measured in miles/gallon) and a certain amount of fuel in the gas tank.
The efficiency is specified in the constructor, and the initial fuel level is 0.
Supply a method drive that simulates driving the car for a certain distance,
reducing the fuel level in the gas tank, and methods getGasLevel , to return the
current fuel level, and addGas , to tank up. Sample usage:
Car myHybrid = new Car(50); // 50 miles per gallon
myHybrid.addGas(20); // Tank 20 gallons
myHybrid.drive(100); // Drive 100 miles
System.out.println(myHybrid.getGasLevel()); // Print fuel remaining
